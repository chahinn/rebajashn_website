# rebajashn_website

Rebajashn.com was the business I created that is similar to Groupon but for the Honduran market when I was 16. The site displayed all the active offers
as well as the featured deal of the day.

The site had functionality to create unique coupon id's automatically, to send the coupon via email to the user or for him to print it out.
Also it had the functionality for business to redeem or validate the coupon id so it does not get used twice.
In addition, the website had a search engine to look for offers more easily as well as several filters.

Business' website built using PHP, Javascript libraries, HTML, CSS, SQL

The old link we used was www.rebajashn.com, unfortunately when the company was bought we were no longer responsible to renew the domain. For that reason it is hard to show the link.
